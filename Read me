# Week 1 – Python & Data Stack: EDA on Titanic 🧠

This notebook explores the Titanic dataset using Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn).

## 🔍 What I Did
- Cleaned and explored the dataset  
- Visualized survival patterns (gender, age, class)  
- Created basic features like `family_size`  
- Summarized key findings  

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Female passengers had higher survival rates  
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive  
- Fare was highly skewed (log normalization helps)
